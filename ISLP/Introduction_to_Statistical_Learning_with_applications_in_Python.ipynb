        "<font face=\"Arial\" size=4>Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for <font face=\"vijaya\" size=5>making sense of complex datasets</font>. In recent years, we have seen a staggering increase in the scale and scope of data collection across virtually all areas of science and industry. As a result, statistical learning has become a critical toolkit for anyone who wishes to understand data — and as more and more of today’s jobs involve data, this means that statistical learning is fast becoming a critical toolkit for <font face=\"vijaya\" size=5>everyone</font>.\n",

        "<font face=\"vijaya\" size=5>An Introduction to Statistical Learning, With Applications in R</font> <font face=\"Arial\" size=4>(ISLR) arose from the clear need for a broader and less technical treatment of the key topics in statistical learning.\n",

        "In recent years *Python* has become an increasingly popular language for data science, and there has been increasing demand for a Python-based alternative to ISLR. Hence, this book,</font><font face=\"vijaya\" size=5> An Introduction to Statistical Learning, With Applications in Python </font> <font face=\"Arial\" size=4>(ISLP), covers the same materials as ISLR but with labs implemented in Python — a feat accomplished by the addition of a new co-author, Jonathan Taylor.</font>\n",
