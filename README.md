# Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python/R

As the scale and scope of data collection continue to increase across virtually all fields, statistical learning has become a critical toolkit for anyone who wishes to understand data. An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides a broad and less technical treatment of key topics in statistical learning. This book is appropriate for anyone who wishes to use contemporary tools for data analysis. 

The first edition of this book, with applications in R (ISLR), was released in 2013. A 2nd Edition of ISLR was published in 2021. The Python edition (ISLP) was published in 2023.

Each edition contains a lab at the end of each chapter, which demonstrates the chapterâ€™s concepts in either R or Python.(Reference: www.statlearning.com)
